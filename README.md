## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid Layout
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla Javascript

### What I learned

With this project I improved my CSS and JS skills. The newest things I learnt are:

- How to create a responsive grid made up of 2 columns and 2 rows of the same dimensions

```css
.downSection {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr;
  grid-template-rows: repeat(4, 1fr);
  gap: 1em;
}

@media (max-width: 520px) {
  .downSection {
    grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr);
    grid-template-rows: repeat(2, 1fr);
  }
}
```

- How to store all elements with same class in a variable and how to change their CSS styles via Javascript

```js
function changeColorPasswords() {
  let allPasswords = document.getElementsByClassName("generatedPassword");
  for (let i = 0; i < allPasswords.length; i++) {
    allPasswords[i].style.color = "var(--clr-bright-green)";
  }
}
```

### Continued development

I'd like to:

- ~~Implement the ability to set the password length~~
- ~~Add 1-click copy password to the clipboard~~
